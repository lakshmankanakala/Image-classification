# Image-classification
 
 
 It classifies the given image by extracting the SIFT features. then it will compares with our trained data set.
In this code I have given 5 different types of animals with each of 50 samples. we can test it by giving the input sift features to test.csv file. 
 	
  Sift Feature.py python file will generate and saves the features into text file foo.csv
  
  the knn_code.py file will take these features and compare with trained data. then gives top 3 related animals for query input.
